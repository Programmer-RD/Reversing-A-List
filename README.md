# Reversing-A-Linked-List-Python-RD

I was learning multi threading a completely different thing from this side project I saw a video, in that a person asked someone to reverse a linked list so I thought to myself Lets try to do it so I tried it and it worked I have two ways how to reverse a linked list but I am not sure if they are like 100% correct or is it the way that I should do but this is for my personal fun.
